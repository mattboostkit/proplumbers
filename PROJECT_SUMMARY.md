## Ready for Launch Checklist
The following priority features have been implemented:
- ✅ Homepage with all CTAs
- ✅ 5 emergency location pages (expandable to all locations)
- ✅ Contact form functionality
- ✅ Click-to-call on all pages
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ SEO structure and meta tags

## What's Still Needed
While the core website is functional, these features would enhance it further:
1. Individual service pages (boiler repair, installation, etc.)
2. Remaining location pages for complete coverage
3. Blog section for content marketing
4. Online booking system integration
5. Google Maps integration
6. Email service connection for contact form
7. Analytics and conversion tracking setup

## Running the Project
```bash
cd proplumbers
npm install
npm run dev
```

The website will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Key Files to Review
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage
- `/src/app/emergency-plumber-[location]/page.tsx` - Dynamic emergency pages
- `/src/config/site.ts` - All site configuration and data
- `/src/components/phone-button.tsx` - Reusable call button

The website successfully addresses the brief's requirements for a fast, SEO-optimized, mobile-first plumbing website with strong emergency service messaging and local search optimization.
